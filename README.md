Hi there!

My name is Omkar Kakade and I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University. Computer Science has always been my passion and I wish to bridge the gap between business and technology. The reason I decided to take this course is to be able to make my own website and to perform analysis on it.

The purpose of this repo is for my Web Development course.
